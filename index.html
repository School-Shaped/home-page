				<h3 class="tldr"> School Shaped is like an year long startup incubator where small teams, design, build and distribute software as part of a school community.</h3>
				<h4 class="body">Each "Build Team" is placed in a different K-12 school. We then mentor each team as they work with students, teachers and staff to design and prototype new tools. Their successes and failures are documented, and effective apps are widely distributed, for free, through School Shaped's app platform. The platform enables continued development by providing identity management, usage data, bug reports and feature requests. 

					Each partner school receives practical benefits from their new software, as well as the empowering experience of co-designing their own tools.

					Each Build Team becomes an experienced design and engineering team, ready to pursue any of their ideas as a startup. After graduating, they remain part of the School Shaped community. We make it easier for them to find funding through partnerships with incubators and VCs, and make it easier to sell their software through our trusted app platform. 

					We are running our first pilot right in partnership with Framingham School District and Olin College. Want more info? Email us at team@schoolshaped.org.</h4>
