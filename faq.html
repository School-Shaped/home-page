		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			When you say you build "tools and experiences", what do you mean?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We'll build nearly anything that a teacher wants to have. One teacher may want a tool that allows them to give lightweight feedback to their students. For that, our team might make a mobile app. However, another teacher might want the experience of teaching their students anatomy in the context of sports. For this, our teams would research appropriate material, and construct an interactive lesson for the teacher to present. Although many of our builders have a background in software engineering, not all projects need to be software.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			So you'll work on anything the teacher wants?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			Almost. We want to help as many teachers as possible. Thus we focus on projects that aren't too specific to one teacher's situation, and are reproducable in another classroom. For instance, our teams <b>won't</b> spend time cleaning a classroom, or organizing student records. However, they <b>will</b> work with the teacher to design a new system to keep the classroom clean, or the records organized. Our desire for generality means that software solutions are sometimes favored, because they can be easily distributed to other classrooms. However, we are also open to non-software projects.

	<div class="row question-answer">
		<h4 class="col-md-4 question">
			What kind of schools do you normally work with?
		</h4>
		<div class="col-md-7 col-md-offset-1 answer">
			We like to work with low income schools when possible - they have the most need for extra resources, and are least understood by developers. However, our most important criteria is having a teacher that is excited to work with us, regardless of school type!
